            <h2> Local Woman Wins Marathon</h2>
            <img id="blake" src="blake.jpg" alt="blake">
            <p> Estes Park native Laura Blake won the 27th Front Range Marathon over an elite field of the best
                long-distance
                runners in the country. Laura's time of 2 hr. 28 min. 21 sec. was only 2 minutes off the women's course
                record
                set last year by Sarah Rawlings. Kathy Lasker and Lisa Peterson finished second and third,
                respectively.
                Laura's victory came on the heels of her performance at the NCAA Track and Field Championships, in
                which
                she
                placed second running for Colorado State.
                In an exciting race, Peter Teagan of San Antonio, Texas, used a finishing kick to win the men's
                marathon
                for
                the second straight year, in a time of 2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the race, Kyle Wills of
                Billings, Montana, finished second when he could not match Teagan's finishing pace. Jason Wu of
                Boulder,
                Colorado, placed third in a very competitive field.
                This year's race through downtown Boulder boasted the largest field in the marathon's history, with
                over
                9500
                men and 6700 women competing. Race conditions were perfect with low humidity and temperatures that
                never
                exceeded 85 degrees.</p>

            <h2> Highway 7 Reopens</h2>
            Cougar sightings have increased 40% in the Este Park area according to a report released yesterday by the
            state
            DNR. In the last month alone, there were ten sightings in Estes Park and the surrounding communities of
            Grand
            Lake and Pinewood Springs. This compares to only twelve sightings for the entire spring of last year.
            Reasons for the growing number of cougar sightings include increasing encroachment by people into former
            wildlife habitats and new wildlife regulations that result in decreasing numbers of elk and deer being
            taken by
            hunters. Cougars may be wandering into developed areas, following the herds.
            DNR spokesman Steve Tasker asks residents to call the DNR report line at 555-6981 if they believe they have
            seen a cougar or any large predatory animal. Two fatalities have already occurred in the west this year
            from
            cougar attacks.

            <h2>If You Encounter a Cougar</h2>
            Stop, stand tall, and don't run. A cougar's instinct is to chase.
            Try to appear larger than the cougar by raising your arms.
            Back away slowly, always keeping eye contact.
            If the cougar displays aggressive behavior, shout and wave your arms. Convince the cougar that you are not
            prey, but a potential danger.
            In case of an attack, stay on your feet and fight back aggressively.
