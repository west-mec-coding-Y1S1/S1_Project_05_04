                    <p>Park City native Laura Blake won the 27th Front Range Marathon over an elite field of the best
                        long-distance runners in the country. Laura's time of 2 hr. 28 min. 21 sec. was only 2 minutes
                        off
                        the women's course record set last year by Sarah Rawlings. Kathy Lasker and Lisa Peterson
                        finished
                        second and third, respectively. Laura's victory came on the heels of her performance at the
                        NCAA
                        Track and Field Championships, in which she placed second running for Colorado State.</p>
                    <p>In an exciting race, Peter Teagan of San Antonio, Texas, used a finishing kick to win the men's
                        marathon for the second straight year, in a time of 2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the
                        race, Kyle Wills of Billings, Montana, finished second when he could not match Teagan's
                        finishing
                        pace. Jason Wu of Boulder, Colorado, placed third in a very competitive field.</p>
                    <p>This year's race through downtown Boulder boasted the largest field in the marathon's history,
                        with
                        over 9500 men and 6700 women competing. Race conditions were perfect with low humidity and
                        temperatures that never exceeded 85 degrees.</p>

                    <p>Highway 7 will reopen this Friday, June 3rd, after a final safety inspection. A late blizzard
                        delayed road crews, marking this as one of the latest dates on record for the highway's
                        reopening.</p>
                    <p>Rising to an elevation of over 12,000 feet, Highway 7 is a main link between Estes Park and
                        Grand
                        Lake. The reopening of the road is one of the annual signs that summer is near and the tourist
                        season will soon be upon us!</p>

                    <!-- This creates a heading called Courgar Sightings Increase -->
                    <h1>Cougar Sightings Increase</h1>
                    <!-- This creates the paragraphs to the website from the txt file called story 3 -->
                    <p>Cougar sightings have increased 40% in the Este Park area according to a report released
                        yesterday
                        by the state DNR. In the last month alone, there were ten sightings in Estes Park and the
                        surrounding communities of Grand Lake and Pinewood Springs. This compares to only twelve
                        sightings
                        for the entire spring of last year.</p>
                    <p>Reasons for the growing number of cougar sightings include increasing encroachment by people
                        into
                        former wildlife habitats and new wildlife regulations that result in decreasing numbers of elk
                        and
                        deer being taken by hunters. Cougars may be wandering into developed areas, following the
                        herds.</p>
                    <p>DNR spokesman Steve Tasker asks residents to call the DNR report line at 555-6981 if they
                        believe
                        they have seen a cougar or any large predatory animal. Two fatalities have already occurred in
                        the
                        west this year from cougar attacks.</p>

                    <p>Stop, stand tall, and don't run. A cougar's instinct is to chase.</p>
                    <p>Try to appear larger than the cougar by raising your arms.</p>
                    <p>Back away slowly, always keeping eye contact.</p>
                    <p>If the cougar displays aggressive behavior, shout and wave your arms. Convince the cougar that
                        you
                        are not prey, but a potential danger.</p>
                    <p>In case of an attack, stay on your feet and fight back aggressively.</p>
